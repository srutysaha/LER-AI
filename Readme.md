## 🖼️ Google Teachable Machine Projects

These are simple AI models created using Google’s **Teachable Machine**, which can recognize images and sounds:

* **Image Recognition Model** – Detects and identifies different shapes
  [Try it here](https://identifyshapes.netlify.app/)
* **Voice Recognition Model** – Identifies different sounds
  [Try it here](https://identifysound.netlify.app/)

> *You don’t need to install anything. Just open the links in a browser and test them.*

## 💬 Chatbots

These are programs that can have a conversation with a user:

* **Basic Chatbot** – Works with simple rules using if-else statements
  File: `chatbot1.py`
* **Advanced Chatbot** – Uses AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand questions better
  File: `chatbotai.py`

> *Think of these as simple “talking robots” that can answer questions.*

## 📊 Working with Datasets

This section shows how we handle real-world data to make predictions:

* **Notebook for Practice** – Step-by-step explanation of working with the Titanic dataset
  [Open Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1h9BcMD86zPHZL57zVLuCC0BK1kWQFFQ5?usp=sharing)
* **Original Dataset** – Raw Titanic data: `titanic.csv`
* **Cleaned Dataset** – Data after removing errors and making it ready for analysis: `titanic_cleaned.csv`

> *A dataset is just a table of information, like an Excel sheet, that we can use to train models or make predictions.*

## 🎙️ Voice Assistant

* **Voice Assistant Program** – A small program that can listen to your voice and respond
  File: `vc.py`

> *This is like a mini version of Siri or Alexa that runs on your computer.*

### ✅ Notes for Future Users

* All files are ready to run.
* If you’re not technical, you can **open the notebooks and web links directly**.
* The code is commented, so you can read it like a story.
